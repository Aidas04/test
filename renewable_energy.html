		<p>Renewable energy is a form of energy that can replenish over time and can be reused naturally. Solar energy
			comes from the sun. Wind energy comes from the wind. Hydro energy comes from the water. The way in which
			humans collect this energy all varies based on the energy. Solar panels can harness the energy of the sun.
			Wind turbines can harness energy from the wind. Hydro dams can harness energy from flowing water. Each
			energy type is naturally found on the planet therefore it is classified as a renewable energy. Although
			these methods are used to harness the energy, a large population still choose to use non-renewable energy
			such as fossil fuels that cannot be reused and harm the planet.</p>

			<h2 id="head-n4">How You Can Help</h2>
			<p>Knowledge is power. When it comes to Renewable Energy, you can help by simply learning about the topic or
				a specific type of energy. Perhaps it will trigger an interest for a career in Renewable Energy or
				become a fun fact that you can pull out when a conversation gets dull. Either way, learning anything new
				about Renewable Energy will help you understand how many everyday objects work and how you can make a
				change to be greener! Below we have a list of 10 types of Renewable Energy that you could learn about.
				Simply choose a topic or press the "Generate" button for a random number if you are picky.</p>
